#### Research
My research focuses on collaborative and communal machine learning, aiming to efficiently and effectively develop all-rounded LLMs. I explore methods that blend diverse skills, including safety, tool use, coding, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities. These methods encompass model merging, modular composition, and model adaptation.
